It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. While no consensual definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) exists, AI is broadly characterized as the study of computations that allow for perception, reason and action. Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces humans\u2019 ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making. This paper examines features of artificial Intelligence, introduction, definitions of AI, history, applications, growth and achievements.",

More advanced AI engines are employed to monitor and detect fraudulent | None | None | None | None\npayment card transactions in real time. | None | None | None | None\n2.

Voice recognition, coupled with simulated human dialog, is the first point of interaction in a customer service | None | None | None | None\ninquiry. Higher-level inquiries are redirected to a human. | None | None | None | None\n3. Medicine: A medical clinic can use AI systems to organize bed schedules, make a staff rotation, and provide medical | None | None | None | None\ninformation. AI has also application in fields of cardiology (CRG), neurology (MRI), embryology (sonography), complex | None | None | None | None\noperations of internal organs etc. | None | None | None | None\n4. Heavy Industries : Huge machines involve risk in their manual maintenance and working.

Telecommunications: Many telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search in the management of their | None | None | None | None\nworkforcesfor example BT Group has deployed heuristic search in a scheduling application that provides the work schedules | None | None | None | None\nof 20000 engineers. | None | None | None | None\n6.

Seeing at the development | None | None | None\nNone | of AI, is it that the future world is becoming artificial. Biological intelligence is fixed, because it is an old, mature paradigm, | None | None | None\nNone | but the new paradigm of non-biological computation and intelligence is growing exponentially. The memory capacity of the | None | None | None\nNone | human brain is probably of the order of ten thousand million binary digits. But most of this is probably used in remembering | None | None | None\nNone | visual impressions, and other comparatively wasteful ways . Hence we can say that as natural intelligence is limited and | None | None | None\nNone | volatile too world may now depend upon computers for smooth working.A | None | None | rtificial intelligence (AI) is truly a revolutionary\nNone | feat of computer science, set to become a core component of all modern software over the coming years and decades. This | None | None | None\nNone | presents a threat but also an opportunity. AI will be deployed to augment both defensive and offensive cyber operations. | None | None | None\nNone | Additionally, new means of cyber attack will be invented to take advantage of the particular weaknesses of AI technology. | None | None | None\nNone | Finally, the importance of data will be amplified by AI\u2019s appetite for large amounts of training data, redefining how we must | None | None | None\nNone | think about data protection.
